Ruby Genetic Algorithm Library
==============================

This is a simple implementation of a genetic algorithm.

This library works with Ruby 1.9.2 or newer versions
Together with this gem you may install:

* gnuplot (if you have a mac you can do this via mac port) 
* gnuolotr which is a gem that you can install simply typing into your terminal: `gem install gnuplotr`

Gnuplot and gnuplotr are used to plot the evolution of the best chromosome in the population.

Run the `test/test.rb` to test the algorithm. Otherwise you can just the run `ga_gem.rb` file.


Note: If you are using a mac, maybe you'll need to install the newer version of ruby. Try the [rvm: Ruby Version Manager](http://rvm.beginrescueend.com)!
